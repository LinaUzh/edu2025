                     in which it was held), was an international exhibition that
                     took place in Hyde Park, London, from 1 May to 15 October
                     1851. It was the first in a series of world's fairs,
                     exhibitions of culture and industry that became popular in
                     the 19th century. The event was organised by Henry Cole and
                     Prince Albert, husband of Victoria, Queen of the United

                     The future Arts and Crafts proponent William Morris, then a
                     teenager, later said he refused to attend the Exhibition on
                     the grounds of taste.[1] Exhibits showcased include the
                     first public flush toilets invented by George
                     Jennings.[2][3]</p>
                  <p>The opening music, under the superintendence of William

                  <h2 class="content__title">Background </h2>
                  <p>The Great Exhibition was organised by Prince Albert, Henry
                     Cole, Francis Henry, George Wallis, Wentworth Dilke, and
                     other members of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of
                     Arts, Manufactures and Commerce as a celebration of modern
                     industrial technology and design. It was arguably a
                     response to the highly effective French Industrial
                     Exposition of 1844: indeed, its prime motive was for
                     Britain to make
                     "clear to the world its role as industrial leader".[6]
                     Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort, was an
                     enthusiastic promoter of the self-financing exhibition; the
                     government was persuaded to form the Royal Commission for
                     the Exhibition of 1851 to establish the viability of
                     hosting such an exhibition. Queen Victoria visited three
                     times with her family, and 34 times on her own.[7] Although
                     the Great Exhibition was a platform on which countries from
                     around the world could display their achievements, Britain
                     sought to prove its own superiority. The British exhibits
                     at the Great Exhibition
                     "held the lead in almost every field where strength, durability, utility and quality were concerned, whether in iron and steel, machinery or textiles."[8]
                     Britain also sought to provide the world with the hope of a
                     better future. Europe had just emerged from
                     "two difficult decades of political and social upheaval,"
                     and now Britain hoped to show that technology, particularly
                     its own, was the key to a better future.</p>
                  <p>Sophie Forgan says of the exhibition that
                     "Large, piled-up 'trophy' exhibits in the central avenue revealed the organisers' priorities; they generally put art or colonial raw materials in the most prestigious place. Technology and moving machinery were popular, especially working exhibits."
                     She also notes that visitors
                     "could watch the entire process of cotton production from spinning to finished cloth. Scientific instruments were found in class X, and included electric telegraphs, microscopes, air pumps and barometers, as well as musical, horological and surgical instruments."[9]</p>
                  <p>A special building, or "The Great Shalimar",[10] was built
                     to house the show. It was designed by Joseph Paxton with
                     support from structural engineer Charles Fox, the committee
                     overseeing its construction including Isambard Kingdom
                     Brunel, and went from its organisation to the grand opening
                     in just nine months. The building was architecturally
                     adventurous, drawing on Paxton's experience designing
                     greenhouses for the sixth Duke of Devonshire. It took the
                     form of a massive glass house, 1848 feet long by 454 feet
                     wide (about 563 metres by 138 metres) and was constructed
                     from cast iron-frame components and glass made almost
                     exclusively in Birmingham[11] and Smethwick. From the
                     interior, the building's large size was emphasized with
                     trees and statues; this served, not only to add beauty to
                     the spectacle, but also to demonstrate man's triumph over
                     nature.[6] The Crystal Palace was an enormous success,
                     considered an architectural marvel, but also an engineering
                     triumph that showed the importance of the exhibition
                     itself.[8] The building was later moved and re-erected in
                     1854 in enlarged form at Sydenham Hill in south London, an
                     area that was renamed Crystal Palace. It was destroyed by
                     fire on 30 November 1936.[10]</p>
                  <p>Six million people—equivalent to a third of the entire
                     population of Britain at the time—visited the Great
                     Exhibition. The average daily attendance was 42,831 with a
                     peak of 109,915 on 7 October.[12] Thomas Cook arranged
                     travel to the event for 150,000 people and it was important
                     in his company's development. The event made a surplus of
                     £186,000 (£33,221,701.65 in 2023), which was used to found
                     the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the
                     Natural History Museum. They were all built in the area to
                     the south of the exhibition, nicknamed Albertopolis,
                     alongside the Imperial Institute. The remaining surplus was
                     used to set up an educational trust to provide grants and
                     scholarships for industrial research; it continues to do so
                     today.[13]</p>
                  <p>The exhibition caused controversy as its opening
                     approached. Some conservatives feared that the mass of
                     visitors might become a revolutionary mob.[14] The
                     English-born King Ernest Augustus I of Hanover, shortly
                     before his death, wrote to Lord Strangford about it :</p>
                  <p>The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this
                     trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind,
                     and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist
                     on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as
                     no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on
                     the occasion. The idea ... must shock every honest and
                     well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is
                     conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.[15]</p>
                  <p>In modern times, the Great Exhibition is a symbol of the
                     Victorian Age, and its thick catalogue, illustrated with
                     steel engravings, is a primary source for High Victorian
                     design.[16] The Albert Memorial to the exhibition, crowned
                     with a statue of Prince Albert, is located behind the Royal
                     Albert Hall.[17] It is inscribed with statistics from the
                     exhibition, including the number of visitors and exhibitors
                     (British and foreign), and the profit made.
                     A range of medals were produced and awarded to exhibitors,
                     jurists and providers of services.[18]</p>
