                  Design history is the study of objects of design in their
                  historical and stylistic contexts.[1] With a broad definition,
                  the contexts of design history include the social, the
                  cultural, the economic, the political, the technical and the
                  aesthetic. Design history has as its objects of study all
                  designed objects including those of architecture, fashion,
                  crafts, interiors, textiles, graphic design, industrial design
                  and product design. Design theorists revamp historical
                  techniques and they use these aspects to create more
                  sophisticated techniques of design. It acts as a tool to
                  better future aspects of design.Design history is the study of
