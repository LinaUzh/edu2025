            <h4>Childhood</h4>
            <p>Salvador Dalí was born on 11 May 1904 to notary Salvador Dalí
               i Cusi (1872–1952) and Felipa Domenech (1874–1921) in the town
               of Figueres in <a class="link"
                  href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%96%D1%8F"
                  target="_blank">Catalonia</a> , in the north-east of the
               Kingdom of
               Spain . He was born nine months after the death of his
               brother, also named Salvador (1901–1903). When he was five
               years old, his parents took him to his brother's grave and
               told him that he was his reincarnation . The news that he was
               a copy of his brother caused him to fear his brother's grave
               and a desire to prove his uniqueness to the world. </p>
            <p>From early childhood, Salvador demonstrated a bright
               individuality, in particular through his energy and
               eccentricity, which manifested itself in frequent whims and
               tantrums. This behavior irritated his father, who reacted
               negatively to his son's antics, while his mother, on the
               contrary, always supported and forgave him. As a result, in
               Salvador's mind, his father became a symbol of severity and
               evil, and his mother - the personification of goodness.</p>
            <p>Salvador's talent for drawing appeared at a fairly young age.
               Already at the age of four, he, with a diligence that was
               surprising for such a young child, tried to draw. Salvador
               Dali painted his first painting when he was six years old. It
               was a small impressionistic landscape , painted with oil
               paints on a wooden board. </p>
            <p>Dali would sit in a small, specially designed room for this
               purpose for whole days, drawing pictures. In the town of
               Figueres , Dali took drawing lessons from Professor Joan
               Núñez. Among the favorite paintings of the young Dali was the
               composition of the French artist Millet "Angelus" (the first
               word of the prayer "Angelus Domini", which means
               "Angel of the Lord"), which depicts a scene of the evening
               prayer of potato pickers .</p>
